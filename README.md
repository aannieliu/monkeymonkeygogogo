## monkey, monkey, go! go! go!

####Andong Liu, Yulei Wang and Xiaoran Zhang

This repository contains code files of reinforcement learning of the game Swing Monkey.

Please read [Task.pdf](https://github.com/aannieliu/monkeymonkeygogogo/blob/master/Task.pdf) for a description of the game and out goal.

Please read Report.pdf for a description of what we did.


[model_Q_1.py](https://github.com/aannieliu/monkeymonkeygogogo/blob/master/model_Q_1.py)  has the code for the Q-learning model mentioned in the report.
            This code also saves a dictionary containing (the number of iterations, the current scores and highest scores) after running the model.

[model_Q_2.py](https://github.com/aannieliu/monkeymonkeygogogo/blob/master/model_Q_2.py)  has the codeo for the Q-learning model 2.0 mentioned in the report.
            This code also saves a dictionary containing (the number of iterations, the current scores, highest scores and the proportion of non-zero Q-matrix entries) after running the model.
